# Cheap_depth_sensor
3D depth perception sensors generally use a pair of image sensors and an array of IR leds to gather enough information to run DL algorithms which generates 3 dimentional point cloud data.
Generally the ones on the market are expensive and have proprietary connections, which makes them less veratile.
